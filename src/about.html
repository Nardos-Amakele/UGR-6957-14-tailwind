            <p>Welcome to my world! I'm thrilled to have you here. </p>
            <p>I'm a young and enthusiastic student currently studying at Addis Ababa University. My passion lies in the fascinating realms of web development and software engineering. Being a creative soul, I love infusing art into my work, bringing a unique and aesthetic touch to everything I create.</p>

            <p>Ethiopia, particularly Hawassa, is my beloved hometown, and its vibrant culture and heritage fuel my creativity. I draw inspiration from its diverse art forms and traditional music, which constantly enrich my work.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding or designing, you'll find me immersed in various creative pursuits. I enjoy expressing myself through art, experimenting with different mediums, and exploring the power of music to evoke emotions. It's safe to say that creativity, in all its forms, is my passion and my driving force.</p>
            <p>As a young female in the tech industry, I'm determined to break barriers and make my mark. I find immense joy in learning about history, as it provides a rich tapestry of inspiration for my projects.  One of my favorite quotes is from Emperor Hailesilassie which you can check out <a href="#below">here.</a></p>
